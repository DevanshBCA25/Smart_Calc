# 🧮SmartCalc LLM – AI MathBoard Assistant

SmartCalc LLM is an AI-powered interactive math assistant built using Streamlit, SymPy, and OpenAI GPT.
It allows users to solve mathematical expressions, trigonometric functions, matrices, determinants, and symbolic equations — all while interacting with a digital whiteboard for visual problem-solving.

# 🚀 Features

✅ Safe Expression Evaluation – Solve arithmetic and trigonometric expressions without using Python’s eval().
✅ Symbolic Computation – Simplify, differentiate, or expand equations using SymPy.
✅ Matrix Operations – Compute transpose, rank, determinant, inverse, and eigenvalues.
✅ Interactive Whiteboard – Write or draw equations directly in the app.
✅ AI Step-by-Step Explanations – Get detailed explanations powered by OpenAI GPT.
✅ Smart UI – Clean Streamlit interface with side panel controls and multi-mode operations.
